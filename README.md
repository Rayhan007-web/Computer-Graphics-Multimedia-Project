#Rotating Fan

Summery:

In this mini-project,I have demonstrated the Rotation of Fan by using OpenGL and the model is designed with C++ code. OpenGL is a freely available Computer Graphics operating system. Here we use header files of, OpenGL is an interactive environment. When the program is executed the fan would be rotating at its normal speed and also a mouse click event is added which leads to two options. The first option is for modifying the speed and the second is for quitting. The first option further has two more options i.e., fast and slow. On selecting a fast option the rotation speed of the fan will increase and on selecting a slow option the rotation speed of the fan will decrease.

Problem Narration:

The aim of this project is to design a 3D fan using OpenGL, where the speed of rotation of the fan can be controlled by the user. This demo displays the Rotation of the fan which is designed and implemented using the C++ program language and APIs provided by OpenGL. It has been developed to undergo user modifications. The user modification can be specification and movement with several other features. It is our first insight into the vast world of interactive graphics.
