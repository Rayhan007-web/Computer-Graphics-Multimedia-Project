#Rotating Fan

In this mini-project,I have demonstrated the Rotation of Fan by using OpenGL and the model is designed with C++ code. OpenGL is a freely available Computer Graphics operating system. Here we use header files of, OpenGL is an interactive environment. When the program is executed the fan would be rotating at its normal speed and also a mouse click event is added which leads to two options. The first option is for modifying the speed and the second is for quitting. The first option further has two more options i.e., fast and slow. On selecting a fast option the rotation speed of the fan will increase and on selecting a slow option the rotation speed of the fan will decrease.
